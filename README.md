# **Egyptian ID Card Recognition System ‚Äì AI-Powered OCR & Fraud Detection**

**A Python-based AI application for detecting, processing, and verifying Egyptian ID cards using YOLO and EasyOCR.**

## **Key Features**

üîπ **AI-Powered ID Detection** ‚Äì Automatically detects and crops Egyptian ID cards from images.  
üîπ **Advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** ‚Äì Extracts Arabic and English text from ID cards using EasyOCR.  
üîπ **Field Extraction & Data Processing** ‚Äì Captures essential details, including:

- Full Name
- Address
- National ID Number
- Birth Date
- Governorate
- Gender
- Birth Place
- Location
- Nationality  

üîπ **Fraud Detection System** ‚Äì Detects fake IDs by verifying the authenticity of the ID photo and personal details.  
üîπ **Web Interface with Streamlit** ‚Äì Provides a user-friendly dashboard for seamless ID card processing.

## **How It Works**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Upload an Image** ‚Äì Use the web interface to upload an Egyptian ID card.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **AI-Powered Detection** ‚Äì The system detects and extracts ID information.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **ID Decoding & Verification** ‚Äì Deciphers ID numbers and flags potential fraudulent documents.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Results Displayed** ‚Äì View structured data, extracted text, and fraud detection status.
